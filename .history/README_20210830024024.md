React Native Cli Project

## Description

This is a boilerplate a rich front end hybrid app made in react-native. The app used redux as its global store for state management and relies heavily on firebase services to give a complete solution of a serverless application.
On its backend, I've made use of serverless cloud functions and firebase authentication and database triggers to make the stack complete. 

Note: I've not uploaded the android and ios folders as they were configured with private connection strings. 

### Installing

* copy pase android and ios folders from a bare react-native project
* npm install
* add connection strings that are missing to android and ios folder files
