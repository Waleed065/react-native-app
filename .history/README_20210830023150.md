React Native Cli Project

## Description

This is a boilerplate of a backend project which I've used in one of my commercial projects. This rich backend would give you an insight of my app archetecture and grip on my work. I've used typescript instead of nodejs here and for deployment I deploy the complied javascript folder which the typescript compiler outputs. I've used mongodb as my primary database with firebase auth for user authentication. I've made the use of socket.io of making a real time chat functionality for my app. On top of all this I also make use of nodemailer for various email notifications to the user. 

Note: If you try to run the project by installing the packages only then it may not work. I've removed all connection strings and sensitive information that was need to connect the app. However you can put your own connection strings and you're good to go.


### Installing

* npm install
* add connection strings that are missing
